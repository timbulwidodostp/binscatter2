{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt binscatter2} is an enhanced version of Michael Stepner's fantastic -binscatter- program, optimized
especially for large datasets, with a few new bells and whistles. For large datasets (those with more
than one million observations), binscatter2 typically runs several times faster than binscatter, with 
relative performance improvements increasing unboundedly for even larger datasets.

{pstd}
Binned scatterplots provide a non-parametric way of visualizing the relationship between two variables.
With a large number of observations, a scatterplot that plots every data point would become too crowded
to interpret visually.  {cmd:binscatter2} groups the x-axis variable into equal-sized bins, computes the
mean of the x-axis and y-axis variables within each bin, then creates a scatterplot of these data points.
The result is a non-parametric visualization of the conditional expectation function.

{pstd}
{opt binscatter2} provides built-in options to control for covariates before plotting the relationship
(see {help binscatter2##controls:Controls}).  Additionally, {cmd:binscatter} will plot fit lines based
on the underlying data, and can automatically handle regression discontinuities (see {help binscatter##fit_line:Fit Line}).

{pstd}
{opt binscatter2} also provides a few tools to visualize more aspects of a conditional distribution function.
Suppose you are interested in visualizing what the distribution of y looks like at several values of a variable x.
Binned scatterplots traditionally let you look at the mean or median value of y within each 'bin'. Binscatter2 also allows
you to overlay various quantiles of the conditional distribution of x, or show how the variance of y changes conditional on x. 



{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Main}

{marker by_notes}{...}
{phang}{opth by(varname)} plots a separate series for each by-value.  Both numeric and string by-variables
are supported, but numeric by-variables will have faster run times.

{pmore}Users should be aware of the two ways in which {cmd:binscatter2} does not condition on by-values:

{phang3}1) When combined with {opt controls()} or {opt absorb()}, the program residualizes using the restricted model in which each covariate
has the same coefficient in each by-value sample.  It does not run separate regressions for each by-value.  If you wish to control for 
covariates using a different model, you can residualize your x- and y-variables beforehand using your desired model then run {cmd:binscatter}
on the residuals you constructed.

{phang3}2) When not combined with {opt discrete} or {opt xq()}, the program constructs a single set of bins
using the unconditional quantiles of the x-variable.  It does not bin the x-variable separately for each by-value.
If you wish to use a different binning procedure (such as constructing equal-sized bins separately for each
by-value), you can construct a variable containing your desired bins beforehand, then run {cmd:binscatter} with {opt xq()}.

{phang}{opt med:ians} creates the binned scatterplot using the median x- and y-value within each bin, rather than the mean.
This option only affects the scatter points; it does not, for instance, cause {opt linetype(lfit)}
to use quantile regression instead of OLS when drawing a fit line.

{dlgtab:Bins}

{phang}{opth n:quantiles(#)} specifies the number of equal-sized bins to be created.  This is equivalent to the number of
points in each series.  The default is {bf:20}. If the x-variable has fewer
unique values than the number of bins specified, then {opt discrete} will be automatically invoked, and no
binning will be performed.
This option cannot be combined with {opt discrete} or {opt xq()}.

{pmore}
Binning is performed after residualization when combined with {opt controls()} or {opt absorb()}.
Note that the binning procedure is equivalent to running xtile, which in certain cases will generate
fewer quantile categories than specified. (e.g. {stata sysuse auto}; {stata xtile temp=mpg, nq(20)}; {stata tab temp})
  
{phang}{opth gen:xq(varname)} creates a categorical variable containing the computed bins.
This option cannot be combined with {opt discrete} or {opt xq()}.

{phang}{opt discrete} specifies that the x-variable is discrete and that each x-value is to be treated as
a separate bin. {cmd:binscatter} will therefore plot the mean y-value associated with each x-value.
This option cannot be combined with {opt nquantiles()}, {opt genxq()} or {opt xq()}.

{pmore}
In most cases, {opt discrete} should not be combined with {opt controls()} or {opt absorb()}, since residualization occurs before binning,
and in general the residual of a discrete variable will not be discrete.

{phang}{opth xq(varname)} specifies a categorical variable that contains the bins to be used, instead of {cmd:binscatter} generating them.
This option is typically used to avoid recomputing the bins needlessly when {cmd:binscatter} is being run repeatedly on the same sample
and with the same x-variable.
It may be convenient to use {opt genxq(binvar)} in the first iteration, and specify {opt xq(binvar)} in subsequent iterations.
Computing quantiles is computationally intensive in large datasets, so avoiding repetition can reduce run times considerably.
This option cannot be combined with {opt nquantiles()}, {opt genxq()} or {opt discrete}.

{pmore}
Care should be taken when combining {opt xq()} with {opt controls()} or {opt absorb()}.  Binning takes place after residualization,
so if the sample changes or the control variables change, the bins ought to be recomputed as well.

{marker controls}{...}
{dlgtab:Controls}

{phang}{opth control:s(varlist)} residualizes the x-variable and y-variables on the specified controls before binning and plotting.
To do so, {cmd:binscatter} runs a regression of each variable on the controls, generates the residuals, and adds the sample mean of
each variable back to its residuals.

{phang}{opth absorb(varname)} absorbs fixed effects in the categorical variable from the x-variable and y-variables before binning and plotting,
To do so, {cmd:binscatter} runs an {helpb areg} of each variable with {it:absorb(varname)} and any {opt controls()} specified.  It then generates the
residuals and adds the sample mean of each variable back to its residuals.

{phang}{opt noa:ddmean} prevents the sample mean of each variable from being added back to its residuals, when combined with {opt controls()} or {opt absorb()}.

{phang}{opt altcontrols} implements an alternative procedure to control for a set of covariates, as described in Cattaneo et al. (2019).

{marker fit_line}{...}
{dlgtab:Fit Line}

{marker linetype}{...}
{phang}{opth line:type(binscatter##linetype:linetype)} specifies the type of line plotted on each series.
The default is {bf:lfit}, which plots a linear fit line.  Other options are {bf:qfit} for a quadratic fit line,
{bf:connect} for connected points, and {bf:none} for no line.

{pmore}Linear or quadratic fit lines are estimated using the underlying data, not the binned scatter points. When combined with
{opt controls()} or {opt absorb()}, the fit line is estimated after the variables have been residualized.

{phang}{opth rd(numlist)} draws a dashed vertical line at the specified x-values and generates regression discontinuities when combined with {opt line(lfit|qfit)}.
Separate fit lines will be estimated below and above each discontinuity.  These estimations are performed using the underlying data, not the binned scatter points.

{pmore}The regression discontinuities do not affect the binned scatter points in any way.
Specifically, a bin may contain a discontinuity within its range, and therefore include data from both sides of the discontinuity.

{phang}{opt reportreg} displays the regressions used to estimate the fit lines in the results window.

{dlgtab:Graph Style}

{phang}{cmdab:col:ors(}{it:{help colorstyle}list}{cmd:)} specifies an ordered list of colors for each series

{phang}{cmdab:mc:olors(}{it:{help colorstyle}list}{cmd:)} specifies an ordered list of colors for the markers of each series, which overrides any list provided in {opt colors()}

{phang}{cmdab:lc:olors(}{it:{help colorstyle}list}{cmd:)} specifies an ordered list of colors for the line of each series, which overrides any list provided in {opt colors()}

{phang}{cmdab:nograph} specifies that the graph is not drawn if the savedata() option is used.

{phang}{cmdab:m:symbols(}{it:{help symbolstyle}list}{cmd:)} specifies an ordered list of symbols for each series

{phang}{it:{help twoway_options}}:

{pmore}Any unrecognized options added to {cmd:binscatter} are appended to the end of the twoway command which generates the
binned scatter plot.

{pmore}These can be used to control the graph {help title options:titles},
{help legend option:legends}, {help axis options:axes}, added {help added line options:lines} and {help added text options:text},
{help region options:regions}, {help name option:name}, {help aspect option:aspect ratio}, etc.

{dlgtab:Save Output}

{phang}{opt savegraph(filename)} saves the graph to a file.  The format is automatically detected from the extension specified [ex: {bf:.gph .jpg .png}],
and either {cmd:graph save} or {cmd:graph export} is run.  If no file extension is specified {bf:.gph} is assumed.

{phang}{opt savedata(filename)} saves {it:filename}{bf:.csv} containing the binned scatterpoint data, and {it:filename}{bf:.do} which
loads the scatterpoint data, labels the variables, and plots the binscatter graph.

{phang}{opt nodofile} specifies that the do-file {it:filename}{bf:.do} created by the savedata(filename) option is not created.

{pmore}Note that the saved result {bf:e(cmd)} provides an alternative way of capturing the binscatter graph and editing it.

{phang}{opt replace} specifies that files be overwritten if they already exist

{title:Acknowledgements}

{pstd}Binscatter2 is an enhanced version of binscatter, and therefore owes special thanks to Michael Stepner, who 
developed the present version of binscatter based on a program first written by Jessica Laird.

{pstd}Special thanks are also due to Mauricio Caceres-Bravo, who developed the gtools program that makes the performance
improvements exhibited by binscatter2 possible. Thanks also to Sergio Correa, whose ftools program was (to this author's 
knowledge) the first to demonstrate that hash tables can be used to effectively speed up some of the basic Stata operations
used in this program, which was further refined by gtools.
